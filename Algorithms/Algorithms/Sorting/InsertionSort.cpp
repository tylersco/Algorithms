//  InsertionSort.cpp
//
//  Insertion Sort is analogous to how a human sorts a pile of cards face down on a table. Pick up each card in the pile
//  and shuffle it down your current hand, looking for the spot in the already-sorted-hand where it fits. Note that all of
//  the cards in your hand are always sorted.
